## Web3 Pi

Basic suite of tools and references to existing projects to create and host Ethereum Nodes on the devices from the Raspberry Pi family.

The main goal of this project is to provide a lightweight image creation suite that can be used to deploy Ethereum nodes on various devices from the Raspberry Pi family, including:

- [Raspberry Pi 5 ](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-5/) with 8GB of RAM
- [Raspberry Pi 4 Model B](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/) with 8GB of RAM
- [Compute Module 4](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/compute-module-4/) with 8GB of RAM

Additionally, this project is supposed to:


> **The image takes care of all the necessary steps to run a node, from setting up the environment and formatting the disk to installing, managing, and running the Execution and Consensus clients.**


## 🚀 Node Setup 🚀

To configure an **Ethereum Node**, follow the [instructions](https://web3-pi.github.io/setup-guide/) from the installation manual.

You can also follow the instructions for a particular device setup:

- [Single device](https://web3-pi.github.io/setup-guide/GetStart/single-device/)
- [Pair device](https://web3-pi.github.io/setup-guide/GetStart/pair-devices/)
